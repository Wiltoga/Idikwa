# How to install

Once you downloaded the zip file [here](https://github.com/Wiltoag/IDIKWA-App/releases/latest), you can just extract it somewhere (`C:\Program Files` for example) and run `Idikwa.exe`.
* **If you downloaded the base version (non portable), you need to install [.NET 6.0 x64 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).**
* **If you downloaded the portable version, be sure to extract it in a folder *without* admins rights.**

The record will be saved in a specific folder, under the `Idikwa` folder in your `Documents` as a `.mp3` file with the current date as name.

# API support

Idikwa has an API support since v1.1.0. To use it, download the idikwa.api.zip (or the portable version) in the Releases tab. To use it, you need to have a session of Idikwa running. Then you can simply run the idikwa-api.exe in CLI and it will show the help pannel. If there is any error, the response will **always** start with `error:` and a message explaining the error

Side note : You don't need to put idikwa-api.exe (and its dependencies) in the same directory as the main Idikwa.exe, you are free to ship and use the api .exe in any other project.
